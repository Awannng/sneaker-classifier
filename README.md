# Motivation | Background
The Purpose of the project was to apply machine learning in a niche/fun way
Hence, our sneaker image classifier idea was born!
Cause everyone literally whereâ€™s sneakers all the time and some people are obsessed with them: Sneaker Heads! So we thought this project idea, yet simple, would be very relatable.
